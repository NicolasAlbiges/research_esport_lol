# Research Project


For my fourth year at Epitech I had the opportunity to do a year abroad. I took the decision to do this year at **Heriot-Watt** university for the **master in Data Science**.

The purpose of this project is to do **pre-match prediction in League Of Legends using machine learning with deep analysis of gameplay-styles and player profiles**.

You will find my dissertation about this topic in the file called **dissertation_research_esport_lol.pdf** in root directory.

## Requirements

 * [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


## Compilation

Navigate to the root of the repository from your Terminal and run *python src\ml.py* to start the predictions.


If you want to crete new dataset you can run this cmd *python src\ai.py*.
